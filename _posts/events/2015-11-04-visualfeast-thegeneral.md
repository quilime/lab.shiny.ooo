> **The General** is a 1926 American silent action-adventure comedy featuring an (at the time) astronomical budget of $750,000 USD, starring Buster Keaton and Marion Mack. Keaton performed many dangerous physical stunts on and around the moving train, including jumping from the engine to a tender to a boxcar, sitting on the cow-catcher of the slow moving train while holding a railroad tie, and running along the roof. The climax of the film includes a spectacular moment where a bridge collapses as a railroad train crosses it. The production company left the wreckage of the locomotive in the river bed after the scene was filmed. The wrecked locomotive became a minor tourist attraction for nearly twenty years, until it was salvaged in 1944-45 for scrap during World War II.

> While it resulted in medocre box office returns and panned by critics at the time, it is now considered one of the greatest films ever made. Keaton considered it to be the best of all his movies. With changing tastes and a re-evaluation of his works, audiences and critics would later agree with him, and it is now considered a major classic of the silent era.

Artist/Filmmaker David Michael Dunne is our host, running the real-deal 8mm/16mm classic silent films while encouraging discussion about film and media history. Featuring live acoustic and electronic musical accompaniment (Musicians TBD, but typically Gabe and/or Ryan).

All ages welcome! BYOB and etc. Sliding scale donation of $5 - $10.
