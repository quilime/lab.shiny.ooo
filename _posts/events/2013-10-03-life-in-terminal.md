This course is a command line trick fest and script share, covering set up, workflow enhancements, ssh, networking, compiling, editing, version control, window themes/aesthetics, and more. We'll touch bash, SED, Regular Expressions, and more.

If you have specific questions about using the command line, this is the place to ask them. If you have scripts or tricks of your own, this is the place to share them!

*Prerequisites:* A computer with a 'nix-flavor OS. Could be anything from a Macbook, to a Raspberry PI. If you have Windows installed, 
install a terminal emulator like [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/).
