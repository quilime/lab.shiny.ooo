Having another film night this week at studios at 1242 Market.

This week we'll screen a print of Fritz Lang's 1927 film masterpiece METROPOLIS.

Made in Germany, "Metropolis" is set in a futuristic urban dystopia and follows the attempts of Freder, the wealthy son of the city's ruler, and Maria, a poor worker, to overcome the vast gulf separating the classes of their city. Filming took place in 1925 at a cost of approximately five million Reichsmarks, making it the most expensive film ever released at the time.

Artist/Filmmaker Michael Dunne will be running the projectors.

Featuring live music accompaniment.

Come hang out, bring friends and forward along!
