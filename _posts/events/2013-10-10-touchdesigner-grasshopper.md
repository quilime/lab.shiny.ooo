Projection-Mapping is a technique used for stage and music shows, events, and media-art. This workshop will cover some techniques for generating parametric form with grasshopper to fabricate an object with low-cost materials for projection mapping. We'll create a form with grasshopper for fabrication, and share geometry data in real-time with TouchDesigner resulting in an expressive fabrication and graphics pipeline. 


### Required

- Laptop with a Windows 7 OS, TouchDesigner, Rhino, and Grasshopper installed.

- Touchdesigner has as [Free Thinking Edition](http://www.derivative.ca/088/Downloads/) available on [derivitive.ca](http://www.derivative.ca)
- [Grasshopper](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/) is plugin for Rhino. An [evaluation version](http://www.rhino3d.com/download) of Rhino is avialable via [Rhino3D.com](http://www.rhino3d.com).
