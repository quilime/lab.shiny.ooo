Direct manipulation interfaces allow users to manipulate digital objects in ways that feel like manipulating physical objects in reality.

In this session we'll explore strategies for rapidly prototyping direct manipulation interfaces. In particular we'll look at numerical constraint solving, an implementation technique that complements the spatial capabilities of humans with the number-crunching capabilities of computers. This technique was used to develop [Recursive Drawing](http://recursivedrawing.com/) and [Refractor](http://refractor.pixelshaders.com/).

We'll look at impressive direct manipulation interfaces from the past (Ivan Sutherland's [Sketchpad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOZqRJzE8xg) and Takeo Igarashi's [Teddy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2H35SlLmUA)) and discuss where direct manipulation can take us in the future.

Examples will be in javascript but the principles apply to any programming language.

*Prerequisites:* You can code your own drag & drop interface in javascript from scratch and you're comfortable with the concept of vectors.

*Materials:* Bring your laptop and any additional hardware you'd like to experiment with (e.g. multitouch tablet, Leap Motion, etc.)
